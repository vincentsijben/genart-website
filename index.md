A bit of a weird name for a company, as 'genart' is an abbreviation for generative art. But hey, I needed a name, and already got genart.nl ðŸ˜Ž
Hi there! My name is Vincent Sijben, a lecturer creative coding over at Maastricht Institute of Arts. In my spare time I like to dive into topics of creative coding, but never took the chance to write about them.
