A bit of a weird name for a company, as 'genart' is an abbreviation for generative art. But hey, I needed a name, and I already owned genart.nl ðŸ˜Ž
Hi there! My name is Vincent Sijben, I'm a lecturer creative coding over at Maastricht Institute of Arts. In my spare time I like to dive into topics of creative coding, but never took the ~~chance~~ time to write about them.

So, go check out my in-depth article about [randomness in p5.js](randomness/) (still a work in progress ðŸ˜„)!!
